### setup
run from root ./start.sh
this would install all dependencies in both FE and BE

### tools used
FE: vite, styled component, typescript, fetch api
BE: expressjs, Luhn algorithme as an npm package

### how it works
- user can select many digits
- user can generate single token
- user can generate infinite tokens
- user can filter by valid tokens only

### infinite generation
It validates tokens one by one in real time

### with more time
- testing could be added
- better styling or ui features could be added
